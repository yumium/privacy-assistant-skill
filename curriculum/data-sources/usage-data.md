# Usage data

Usage data is data collected about how a user interacts with a device.

Usage data can consist of user IP, settings, login times, what features the user uses the most, interaction patterns, how long the user spend on each section of the software etc.

Usage data is very valuable to companies. They can use it to understand how users interact with their product and hence make the product easier to use. Through the user's interactions, they can infer about their interests and needs. With this information, companies can provide relevant marketing information to them, or personalise the product to their needs.
