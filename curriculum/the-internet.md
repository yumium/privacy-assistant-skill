The internet has revolutionised the way we work and play. It allows us to communicate, to share data and to seek information in a matter of seconds. All this is possible through the use of computers and networks.

The internet is a global network of computers. All computer devices (including PCs, laptops, games consoles and smartphones) that are connected to the internet form part of this network. Added together, there are billions of computers connected to the internet, all able to communicate with each other.

Today, the internet is a massive part of our daily lives.

## How does it work?

The internet is a global network of computers, some of which are called web servers. A web server is a computer which holds websites for other computers linked to the internet to access. Holding a website is known as ‘hosting’. A web server may host one or many websites and webpages. Sending information to a web server is known as uploading. Receiving information from a web server is known as downloading.

When you make a telephone call, a direct connection is formed between you and the person you are calling. While you are making the call, no-one else can communicate with you. A web server needs to be able to communicate with many different computers at the same time. When information is uploaded to, or downloaded from, a web server it is broken up into tiny pieces called data packets. Each packet is a very short communication between the client computer and the web server. Because each communication lasts only milliseconds, the web server can seemingly communicate with many computers at the same time. It is a bit like having several conversations at the same time, but only saying one word to each person in turn.
