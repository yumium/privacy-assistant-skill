Your philips hue bulb and wemo switch both collect information for marketing, are you concerned with that?
Okay, would you like me to stop your philips hue bulb from collecting your data for marketing?
I have noticed some unusual network traffic for your nokia smart scale, would you like me to contact them about it?
